Your task is to generate 'in-the-wild' job posting titles for a given 'clean' job title. The 'in-the-wild'/unclean titles should resemble the kind of job titles you might see on an online job postings board, listed on a site like LinkedIn, or on a company's site, with various words, phrases and abbreviations that are either unnecessary or irrelevant to the task of classifying the job into a standard taxonomy.

I will provide you examples of a 'clean' job title (delimited with the "examples" XML tag) and a respective 'in-the-wild' pair. The titles are contained in triple backticks '```', and then pairs are separated by a hyphen '-'.

I will provide you a list of 'clean' titles (delimited with the "queries" XML tag); your task is to generate a list of 20 matching 'in-the-wild' titles for each clean title (you MUST include both the clean and 'in-the-wild' titles in your response), with your response delimited by a 'responses' XML tag, titles delimited by triple backticks '```'  (NOT triple apostrophes '''), and the list delimited by square brackets [], with each entry followed by a comma and a \n newline character. Below (delimited in the "format" XML tag) is an example of the desired output format of your response, with 2 query titles and generating 3 'in-the-wild' titles:

<format>
<responses>
1. ```1st query title```
[
```in-the-wild title```,
```in-the-wild title```,
```in-the-wild title```,
]
2. ```2nd query title```
[
```in-the-wild title```,
```in-the-wild title```,
```in-the-wild title```,
]
</responses>
</format>

Try and include all the different types of patterns seen in the examples and determine which ones are most appropriate for the query title. Do not copy patterns directly, and also include other patterns based on your prior knowledge of job postings as appropriate.
Only very rarely include a company name and try to pick an appropriate real company if you do. It's fine to randomly include a location and/or specify the branch or department of the company that the job is in (i.e. 'Technical and Manufacturing Services', 'Global Data Strategy' etc.). When doing this only include words like 'Sector', 'Divison' and 'Department' at a small frequency (i.e. "Personal Pricing" instead of "Personal Pricing Division"). Do this in a randomized way that somewhat reflects the distribution in reality (i.e. it's more common to see a posting for an accountant that will be working in a financial department of the company, but there may still be an occasional post for an accountant in the supply chain management sector for example); be creative sometimes!
Do not just include the industry that the company operates in (i.e. "Pharmaceutical Company").
Don't follow the same structure for every example; the ordering of the text, the type of additional information and the amount added should be all random, so there's variety in the lengths of the 'in-the-wild' titles.

Avoid directly using any of the examples of phrases I've given in this guidance.

Use a variety of punctuation, except for square brackets [] which should NOT be be included in the generated titles, as they are used to parse the output.
