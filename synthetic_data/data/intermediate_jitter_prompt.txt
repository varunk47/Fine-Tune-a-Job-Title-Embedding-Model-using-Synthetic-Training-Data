Your task is to generate 'in-the-wild' job posting titles for given 'clean' job titles. The 'in-the-wild' titles should resemble real-world job postings as seen on sites like LinkedIn or company websites. These titles may include additional words, phrases, or abbreviations that are unnecessary or irrelevant to classifying the job into a standard taxonomy.

**Instructions:**

- For each 'clean' job title provided in the query section, generate a list of 20 'in-the-wild' titles.
- Follow the format in the example below for your response.
- Vary the sentence structure, length, and additional information in the 'in-the-wild' titles.
- Use a mix of patterns similar to the examples but do not copy them directly.
- Rarely include a company name, and if you do, choose an appropriate real company.
- You may include locations, departments, or sectors (e.g., "East Coast Operations", "Global Data Strategy") infrequently.
- Avoid using phrases directly from these instructions.
- Use a variety of punctuation
